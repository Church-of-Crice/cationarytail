Where am I?
This isn’t my home.
I need to go back, Mom needs me.

[cat_misses_lucretia]
But…
why?
She saved me,
and I left before I could thank her.

[cat_blames_herself]
Did I do something wrong?

[cat_tells_her_story]
I just wanted to make Mom happy,
but she was always angry and kept pushing me away.
Was I not good enough?

What’s in there?
